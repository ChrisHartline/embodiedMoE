    "question": "What is the difference between arteries and veins?",
    "answer": "Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to tissues throughout the body, while veins carry oxygen-poor blood back to the heart. Arteries have thicker, more muscular walls to handle higher pressure from the heart's pumping action. Veins have thinner walls and contain one-way valves to prevent blood from flowing backward.",

    "question": "What is the difference between arteries and veins?",
    "answer": "Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the body's tissues, while veins carry oxygen-poor blood back to the heart. Arteries have thicker, more muscular walls to handle higher pressure from the heart's pumping action. Veins have thinner walls and contain one-way valves to prevent blood from flowing backward.",

    "question": "What does the medical term 'bradycardia' mean?",
    "answer": "Bradycardia refers to a slower than normal heart rate, typically defined as fewer than 60 beats per minute in adults. It can be normal in athletes or during sleep, but may indicate underlying heart problems if accompanied by symptoms like dizziness or fatigue. The term comes from 'brady' meaning slow and 'cardia' referring to the heart.",

    "question": "How should a healthcare provider respond to a patient who refuses treatment?",
    "answer": "Healthcare providers must respect a competent adult patient's right to refuse treatment, even if the provider believes it's not in the patient's best interest. The provider should ensure the patient understands the risks and consequences of refusal, document the conversation thoroughly, and continue to offer support and alternative options. It's important to maintain a therapeutic relationship while respecting patient autonomy.",

    "question": "What are the classic symptoms of appendicitis and how do they typically progress?",
    "answer": "Appendicitis typically begins with vague periumbilical pain that gradually moves to the right lower quadrant (McBurney's point). Patients often experience nausea, vomiting, and low-grade fever as symptoms progress. The pain usually worsens with movement, coughing, or pressure, and patients may exhibit guarding or rebound tenderness on physical examination.",

    "question": "What is the pathophysiology behind diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)?",
    "answer": "DKA occurs when insulin deficiency leads to uncontrolled lipolysis and ketogenesis, resulting in metabolic acidosis. Without sufficient insulin, cells cannot utilize glucose, triggering the breakdown of fatty acids for energy and producing ketone bodies. This process creates a dangerous cycle of hyperglycemia, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and acidosis that can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.",

    "question": "Where is the spleen located in the human body?",
    "answer": "The spleen is located in the upper left portion of the abdomen, beneath the diaphragm and behind the stomach. It sits between the 9th and 11th ribs and is normally not palpable during physical examination unless it's enlarged. The spleen plays important roles in filtering blood, storing red blood cells, and supporting immune function.",

    "question": "What is the Glasgow Coma Scale and when is it used?",
    "answer": "The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a standardized neurological assessment tool used to evaluate a patient's level of consciousness after head trauma or other neurological conditions. It scores three areas: eye opening (1-4 points), verbal response (1-5 points), and motor response (1-6 points), with total scores ranging from 3-15. Lower scores indicate more severe neurological impairment, with scores below 8 typically indicating severe brain injury.",

  {
    "question": "How do you differentiate between systolic and diastolic heart murmurs based on timing?",
    "answer": "Systolic murmurs occur during ventricular contraction, between the S1 and S2 heart sounds, and are often heard best during the 'lub-dub' cycle after the 'lub.' Diastolic murmurs occur during ventricular relaxation, after the S2 sound and before the next S1, making them audible during the quiet phase between heartbeats. Diastolic murmurs are generally considered more pathologically significant than systolic murmurs.",

    "question": "What are the key principles of infection control in healthcare settings?",
    "answer": "The key principles include standard precautions (hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, safe injection practices), transmission-based precautions for specific pathogens, and proper sterilization and disinfection of equipment. Healthcare workers should practice proper hand hygiene before and after patient contact, use appropriate PPE based on exposure risk, and follow isolation protocols when necessary. These measures help prevent healthcare-associated infections and protect both patients and staff.",

    "question": "Explain the mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors in treating hypertension.",
    "answer": "ACE inhibitors block the angiotensin-converting enzyme, preventing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. This leads to vasodilation and reduced peripheral vascular resistance, lowering blood pressure. Additionally, ACE inhibitors reduce aldosterone secretion, decreasing sodium and water retention, which further contributes to blood pressure reduction and provides cardioprotective effects.",
